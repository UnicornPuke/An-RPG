To run, install all three files (main, data, and steps.py) and run main.
But first, you must establish a virtual environment (wow, so fancy)
to do this run the following commands in the terminal:

python -m venv env

source env/bin/activate

After doing that you must install string-color by doing this command:

pip install string-color

And to actually start run this command:

python3 main.py

And if you have the extension python-is-python3, just remove the 3.
